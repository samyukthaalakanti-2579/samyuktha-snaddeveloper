Explain passed by value and passed by reference in javascript?
PASSBY VALUE: 
passby value function will called by directly passing the value to the variable as an argument.
if any changes are made inside the function it will not effect the original value.if it is 
passed as an arrgument it create its own copy so it will not effect the original value.
Example:
function Passbyvalue(a, b) {
    let tmp;
    tmp = b;
    b = a;
    a = tmp;
    console.log(`Inside Pass by value 
        function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
}
  
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
console.log(`Before calling Pass by value 
        Function -> a = ${a} b = ${b}`);
  
Passbyvalue(a, b);
  
console.log(`After calling Pass by value 
       Function -> a =${a} b = ${b}`);

PASSBY REFERENCE:
passby reference is directly call by passing the address of the variable as an argument.
it does not create its own copy because it will refer to the orginal value so changes are made 
inside the function affect the original value.
Example:
function PassbyReference(obj) {
    let tmp = obj.a;
    obj.a = obj.b;
    obj.b = tmp;
  
    console.log(`Inside Pass By Reference 
        Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
}
  
let obj = {
    a: 10,
    b: 20
  
}
console.log(`Before calling Pass By Reference 
    Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
  
PassbyReference(obj)
  
console.log(`After calling Pass By Reference 
    Function -> a = ${obj.a} b = ${obj.b}`);
