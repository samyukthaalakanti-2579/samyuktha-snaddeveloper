How to access data from one script block to another script block in javascript?
 We use export and import statements to access the data from one script to another 
 export statment can be used , for accessing the data from another script block i.e methods 
 classes or any variables too, by calling its name
 Example:
    export{}
    import statment can be used for importing the entire file by using its path location.
 Example:
    import(../components/src/hello.js)
    this is how we import the blocks directly in to other script block.
