Question 1
1.What is a callback function and callback hell in javascript?
CALLBACK FUNCTION
A callback  function is just a regular function, which is called after another function
has finished executing.The callback functions are nested inside each other since we 
depend on the data from the previous function.
example:
console.log("Before...");
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("It took 500ms to get here!");
}, 500);
console.log("After...");

CALLBACK HELL
In short, callback hell means that you have multiple functions that are asynchronous. 
Those functions depend on each other, which might, in turn, get quite messy with a lot
of callback function that is nested in multiple layers. This will result in chaos, and 
you will end up with code which is hard to read and maintain.
