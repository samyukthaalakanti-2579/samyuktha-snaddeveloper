7.Explain about currying with example? 
CURRING IN JAVASCRIPT
curring in javascript means evaluating functions with the multiple arguments and decomposing
them into the sequence of functions with single argument.simply it is a check method to
check everthing before proceeding. when we want the same call with some the same parameters 
then it helps in passing the same variable again and again.it makes the code easier.
Example:
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  const curriedSum = curry(sum)
  console.log(curriedSum(1)(2))
