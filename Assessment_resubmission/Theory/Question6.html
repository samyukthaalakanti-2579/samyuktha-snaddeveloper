6.What is difference between flex and css grid explain  with example?
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that was designed to provide greater control 
over alignment and space distribution between items within a container. Being one-dimensional,
it only deals with layout in a single direction - columns or rows - at a time. This works well
for smaller layouts, such as components.

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that is aimed towards control of larger layouts,
such as whole page layouts. Similar to tables, it allows for items to be aligned in columns 
and rows. However, CSS Grid is easier to control and provides more layout options than old 
table-based layouts.
