8.Explain about object prototype and add reverse method to String class to reverse a given string?
OBJECT PROTOTYPE
 Prototype is an object,in javascript  it has a build-in property which is prototype.
 as it is object it has own prototype .when we try to access a function object javascript will look
 at its prototype property to see it is there .if it is not present then it goes to the prototype chain
 and try to find.

 for example:
 const string = prompt('Enter a string: ');

  const result = reverseString(string);
 console.log(result);
 the output will be reverse of what the user enters in the prompt box.

  object prototype:
 
   function Student() {
   this.name = 'girish';
   this.gender = 'Male';
 }

  Student.prototype.age = 15;

   var studObj1 = new Student();
   alert(studObj1.age); 
   var studObj2 = new Student();
   alert(studObj2.age); 

    Age="15" for student object2.
