Question 2
2.Explain how to iterate an object in javascript?
There are three ways we can iterate over an object in JavaScript:
1.Using for...in statement
2.Using Object.entries() method and for...of statement
3.Using Object.keys() method and for...of statement.

1.Iterate over object using forâ€¦in statement
To iterate over an object type variable in JavaScript, you need to use the for..in statement.
The for...in statement allows you to iterate over the object property keys, so we can log both 
the property keys and values.
Example:
const obj = {
    name: "Samyuktha",
    age: 22,
    job: "Web developer",
  };
  
  for (const key in obj) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`);
  }

2.Iterate over object using Object.entries() method
The Object.entries() method is a built-in method of the JavaScript Object class that transforms an
object value into a two-dimensional array.
Example:
const obj = {
    name: "Samyuktha",
    age: 22,
    job: "Web developer",
  };
  
  const objArray = Object.entries(obj);
  console.log(objArray);
  
3.Iterate over object using Object.keys() method
Aside from Object.entries(), you can also use the Object.keys() method, which returns your object property
keys as an array.You can then use the for...of statement to iterate over the array and log each object property.
Example:
const obj = {
    name: "Samyuktha",
    age: 22,
    job: "Web developer",
  };
  
  const keys = Object.keys(obj);
  
  for (const key of keys) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${obj[key]}`);
  }
