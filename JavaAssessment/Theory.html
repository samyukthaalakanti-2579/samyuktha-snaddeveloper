Question 1
What is java.what are features of java
Java is a highlevel programming language. it is created by james gosling by sun microsystems in 1991.
Java is a object oriented programming.it is to write a program on multiple operating system.It runs on different platforms.Ex:windows,mac os,unix.
It is also called WORA(write once read anywhere).java supports both standalone applications and web applications.
Features of java:
1.Simple
2.Object-Oriented
3.Portable
4.Platform independent
5.Secured
6.Robust
7.Architecture neutral
8.Interpreted
9.High Performance
10.Multithreaded
11.Distributed
12.Dynamic

Question2
Explain The Architecture of JVM? 
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
Architecture of JVM

Jvm has different blocks:
It has the instruction block  it has the highlevel language it is written by programer or developer.we write it in .java file. then 
we have java c which checks the syntax and it has error problem like synthetical error, compile time error, fixed error. then we have 
bytecode it has the intermediate level language it has .class file or executable file. then we have exectution block it has classloader,
interpreter,just-in-time.this are in jvm and the complete block is known as JRE. INTERPRETER will conveet the intermediate language to lowlevel language.
Decoder will convert the lowlevel to highlevel language.Then we get the output as highlevellanguage.

Question3
What is difference between JDK, JRE, JVM? 
JDK: It stands for java development kit.It is the tool necessary to compile,document and package java programs.it contains JRE+development tools.
JRE:It stands for java runtime environment.JRE refers to a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executable.It is an  implementation of JVM 
which physically exists.
JVM:It stands for java virtual machine.It is an abstract machine.it is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
jvm follows three notations:specification,implementation,runtime instance.

Question4
Explain OOPs Concepts with example programs for each concept?
The main idea of object oriented programming oop concepts include abstraction,encapsulation,inheritance,polymorphism,object and class.
Java defines oop concepts as follows:
1.Object:any entity which exits in real world  is known as object.or,an entity which has its own state and behavior and unique identification is known as object.
2.Class:class is the blue print of an object.Ex:house and planning.
3.Encapsulation:The process of wraping of properties and behavior of an object in a single unit is known as encapsulation.Real time Example:capsul and school bag.
Encapsulation is used to hide the data and to provide the security.we make variable has private.to access we use getter() and setter() methods to access the private variables.
Example:
public class Demo{
    private int a;
    public void setA(int arg){
        a=arg;
    }
    public int getA(){
        return a;
    }
    void display(){
        system.out.println(a);
    }
}
package Encapsulation;
public class DemoMainClass{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        Demo d = new Demo();
        d.setA(40);
        d.getA();
        d.display();
    }
}


4.inheritance: The process of aquriring the properties from parent class to child class with the help of extends keyword is known as inheritance.
extends is the keyword.to provide relationship between two classess, we can achevie inheritance in 2 ways.with the help  of extends keyword,with the help of implements(interface).
Example:
package Inheritance1;

public class ClassStudent
{
int id;
String name;
double marks;
int age;
ClassStudent(int id)
{
  this.id=id;
}
ClassStudent(int id,String name)
{
	this(id);
	this.name=name;
}
ClassStudent(int id,String name,double marks)
{
	this(id,name);
	this.marks=marks;
}
ClassStudent (int id,String name,double marks,int age)
{
this(id,name,marks);	
this.age=age;
}
void print ()
{
	System.out.println("Student details:");
	System.out.println("*************");
	System.out.println("Name:"+name);
	System.out.println("Id:"+id);
	System.out.println("marks:"+marks);
	System.out.println("Age:"+age);
}
}
package Inheritance1;

public class StudentClass
{
public static void main (String[]args)
{
	StudentClass sc = new StudentClass(1234,40.22,22);
	sc.print();	
}
}

5.polymorphism:One object shows the different behavior in different stage in its life cycle is known as polymorphism.
Example:
package Polymorphism;

public class Animal 
{
void noise()
{
	System.out.println(" All Animal Make Noise");
}
}
public class Cat extends Animal
{
	void noise()
	{
		System.out.println("meow----meow----");
	}
}
public class Dog  extends Animal
{
void noise()
{
	System.out.println("bow----bow----");
}
}
public class Snake 
{
void noise()
{
	System.out.println("hiss-----hiss");
}
}
public class AnimalDiverClass
{
	public static void main(String[]args)
	{
		AnimalDriverClass ad= new AnimalDriverClass();
		Cat c =new Cat();
		Dog d=new Dog();
		Snake s =new Snake();
		ad.makenoise(d);
	}
	}

6.Abstraction:The process of hiding the implementation and providing the functionality to user is known as Abstraction.Eg:ATM,Moblie,Bulb.
Advantages:Hiding logical implementation from user.security for implementation.
example:
abstract class Shape {
	String color;
	abstract double area();
	public abstract String toString();
	public Shape(String color)
	{
		System.out.println("Shape constructor called");
		this.color = color;
	}
	public String getColor() { return color; }
}
class Circle extends Shape {
	double radius;

	public Circle(String color, double radius)
	{
		super(color);
		System.out.println("Circle constructor called");
		this.radius = radius;
	}

	@Override double area()
	{
		return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
	}

	@Override public String toString()
	{
		return "Circle color is " + super.getColor()
			+ "and area is : " + area();
	}
}
class Rectangle extends Shape {

	double length;
	double width;

	public Rectangle(String color, double length,
					double width)
	{
		super(color);
		System.out.println("Rectangle constructor called");
		this.length = length;
		this.width = width;
	}

	@Override double area() { return length * width; }

	@Override public String toString()
	{
		return "Rectangle color is " + super.getColor()
			+ "and area is : " + area();
	}
}
public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Shape s1 = new Circle("Red", 2.2);
		Shape s2 = new Rectangle("Yellow", 2, 4);

		System.out.println(s1.toString());
		System.out.println(s2.toString());
	}
}

Question5
Explain Constructor, this, final, super keywords with example programs?
Constructor:Constructor is a special method which is used for initialization. Constructor name must be same as class name.constructor will declare without return type.
Example:
class Constructor{
    int a;
    int b;
    constructor(){
        a=10;
        b=20;
    }
    void display(){
        system.out.println(a+" "+b);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Constructor c = new Constructor();
        c.display();
    }
}

This:this is a keyword used to reference the current object(global/local).
Example:
public class Moblie{
    String model;
    double price;
    private String color;
    public mobile(String model,double price){
        this.mobile=mobile;
        this.price=price;
    }
    void display(){
        system.out.println("mobile model:"+model);
        system.out.println("mobile price:"+price);
        public void setcolor(string color){
            this.color=color;
            System.out.println("Moblie color:"+color);
        }
        public String getColor(){
            return color;
        }
    }
    }
    package Encapsulation
    public class MoblieClass
    {
        public static void main(String[]args){
            Mobile m = new Moblie("nokia",15000.0);
            m.display();
            m.setcolor("black");
            System.out.println("mobile color:"+m.getColor());
        }
    }

Final:final is a keyword and it is a modifier.Final is used to make member(class,variable,method)as constant.
Example:
public class FinalVariable{
    final int a=10;
    public static void main(String[]args){
        FinalVariable fc = new FinalVariable();
        System.out.println(fc.a);
    }
}    

Super:super keyword is used to access the superclass properties is known as super keyword.
Example:
public class Sample{
    int a=10;
    int b=20;
    void test(){
        System.out.println("test()method");
    }
}
public class Sample1 extends sample{
    void display(){
        System.out.println(super.a);
        System.out.println(super.b);
        Super.test();
    }
}
public class SampleClass{
    public static void main(String[]args){
        Sample1 s= new Sample1()
        s.display()
    }
}

question6
Explain difference between Interface and Abstract class with example programs? 
Abstract class:It contains the declaration and defination part.multiple inheritance cannot be implemented by using abstract class.
It contains the constructor .It can also contains some static member.It can contain multiple type of access modifiers such as public ,private,protected.
The performance of an abstract class is very good because it is quick . A class can use only one abstract class.
Interface:Interface is the 100% pure abstraction and it contains declaration part only.Multiple inheritance can be acheived using interface.
It does not contain a constructor.It doesnot contain static members and it contains public access modifiers since everthing is an interface is considered 
public.it can use multiple interface.
Example Interface:
interface Polygon_Shape {
    void calculateArea(int length, int breadth);
}
class Rectangle implements Polygon_Shape {
    public void calculateArea(int length, int breadth) {
        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is " + (length * breadth));
    }
}
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();       
        rect.calculateArea(10, 20);             
    }
}
Example Abstraction:
Astract class TwoDShape {
    private double length;
    private double width;
    
    public TwoDShape(double length, double width) {
       this.length = length; 
       this.width = width;    
     }
    public abstract void draw();
    public double getArea() { 
      return length*width; 
    } 
 }
 public class Rectangle extends TwoDShape { 
    public Rectangle(double length, double width) {
       super(length,width);    
     }
    public void draw() { 
       System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle"); 
     }     
    public static void main (String args[]) {
       TwoDShape rect = new Rectangle(10,10);
       rect.draw(); 
       System.out.println("Area of given rectangle = "+rect.getArea());
    }
 }
 
 Question7
 Explain the concept of multi-Threading? Provide Examples? 
 Multi threading-It is a process of multiple threads executes at same time without dependency of other threads. Many operating systems support kernel thread and user thread in a combined way.
Multi threading model are of 2 types. Process based and thread based multithreading
Example:
public class guruThread1 implements Runnable
{
       public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread guruThread1 = new Thread("Guru1");
        Thread guruThread2 = new Thread("Guru2");
        guruThread1.start();
        guruThread2.start();
        System.out.println("Thread names are following:");
        System.out.println(guruThread1.getName());
        System.out.println(guruThread2.getName());
    }
    @Override
    public void run() {
    }
}

Question8
What is Thread? How many types we can define a thread? Provide Examples for each? 
Thread is a seperate flow of execution .we can define thread in 2 ways 
1.by extends thread class
2.by implementing runnable interface
Example extends:
public class Main extends Thread {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main thread = new Main();
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}
Example runnable:
public class Main implements Runnable {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main obj = new Main();
    Thread thread = new Thread(obj);
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}

Question9
What is Synchronization? Provide Example?
when multiple threads are accessing same object we can allow only one thread using the Synchronization.we can avoid data consistency problem.
Example:
class Table{
 synchronized void printTable(int n){
   for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
     System.out.println(n*i);
     try{
      Thread.sleep(400);
     }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}
   }
 }
}
class MyThread1 extends Thread{
Table t;
MyThread1(Table t){
this.t=t;
}
public void run(){
t.printTable(5);
}

}
class MyThread2 extends Thread{
Table t;
MyThread2(Table t){
this.t=t;
}
public void run(){
t.printTable(100);
}
}

public class TestSynchronization2{
public static void main(String args[]){
Table obj = new Table();
MyThread1 t1=new MyThread1(obj);
MyThread2 t2=new MyThread2(obj);
t1.start();
t2.start();
}
}

Question10
What is the concept of Exception handling ? provide example?
Exception is an event it will terminate the flow of execution abnormally during runtime is known as Exception.
ExceptionHandling will handle abnormal exception with the help of try-catch block.
Example:
public class Sample {
    public static void main(String[]args){
        System.out.println("Main method begins");
        int a=10;
        int b=o;
        try{
            int c=a/b;
        }
        catch(Arthematicexception e){
            system.out.println("Exception handled");
        }
        System.out.println("main method ends");
    }
}

Question11
Explain about throw and throws keyword?
Throw:Throw used with in a method.It can only throw single exception.Followed by a thowable instance.
Used to throw an Exception.
Throws:Throws used with method signature.it can declare multiple exception.it is followed by an exception class name.
it is used to declare an exception.
Example throws:
class tst
{
    public static void main(String[] args)throws InterruptedException
    {
        Thread.sleep(10000);
        System.out.println("Hello Geeks");
    }
}
Example throw:
class Main {
  public static void divideByZero() {
    throw new ArithmeticException("Trying to divide by 0");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    divideByZero();
  }
}

    for(int i=0;i<=n;i++)
    {
        sum=n1+n2;
        System.out.println(" "+sum);

    {       
    System.out.println(num+" * "+i+" = "+num*i);  
    }  
   }  
}

Question17
What is Difference between Synchronization and synchronized block? Provide Examples?  
Synchronization:
  Synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
  In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try to access the shared resources at a time to produce inconsistent results. 
  The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads.
  There are two types of synchronization,they are:
  1)Process Synchronization.
  2)Thread Synchronization.

  Synchronized block:
  Synchronized block can be used to perform synchronization on any specific resource of the method.
  Scope of synchronized block is smaller than the method.
  A Java synchronized block doesn't allow more than one JVM, to provide access control to a shared resource.
  The system performance may degrade because of the slower working of synchronized keyword.
  Java synchronized block is more efficient than Java synchronized method.
  Example Synchronization:
  class Line 
{ 
    synchronized public void getLine() 
    { 
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
        { 
            System.out.println(i); 
            try
            { 
                Thread.sleep(400); 
            } 
            catch (Exception e) 
            { 
                System.out.println(e); 
            } 
            }
            }
            class Train extends Thread {
    Line line; 
    Train(Line line) 
    { 
        this.line = line; 
    } 
    @Override
    public void run() 
    { 
        line.getLine(); 
    } 
} 
class GFG 
{ 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        Line obj = new Line(); 
        Train train1 = new Train(obj); 
        Train train2 = new Train(obj);  
        train1.start(); 
        train2.start(); 
    } 
 }
  
  Example block  Synchronization:
  public class Sync 
{ 
    String name = ""; 
    public int count = 0; 
  
    public void geekName(String sync, List<String> list) 
    { 
        synchronized(this) 
        { 
            name = sync; 
            count++; 
        } 
        list.add(sync); 
        class SYNC
{ 
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    { 
        Sync gk = new Sync(); 
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>(); 
        sy.syncName("mohit", list); 
        System.out.println(sy.name); 
  
    } 
} 

Question18
Explain the concept of Exception and Error with Architecture
Exception is an event it will terminate the flow of execution abnormally during runtime is known as Exception.
Exception is classified into 3 types
1.normal /gracefull termination
2.Forceful termination
3.abnormal termination
