CALLBACK FUNCTION AND CALL BACK HELL
Callback function is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.
Any function can be passed as an argument to another function so it will executed in the other function. 
This is called as callback function.
And callback hell is nested callbacks stacked after one another like pyramid, and everycallback function will wait for the previous callback,to make pyramid structure that effects the maintaing code.
